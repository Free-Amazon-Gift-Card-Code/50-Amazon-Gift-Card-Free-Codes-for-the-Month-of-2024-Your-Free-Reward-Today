### What Are Amazon Gift Cards?

Before we dive deeper into how to use your free Amazon Gift Card, let‚Äôs take a moment to understand what they are and how they work.

Amazon Gift Cards are prepaid cards that allow the holder to make purchases on Amazon.com. These cards can be used just like regular credit or debit cards, and they offer several benefits:

- **Flexible Use**: Amazon Gift Cards can be used to purchase anything sold on Amazon ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs books, electronics, fashion, home goods, or even digital content like movies, music, and games.
  
- **No Expiration**: Unlike many other gift cards that may expire after a certain period, Amazon Gift Cards do not expire. Once you receive your code, you can redeem it whenever you want.

- **Balance Accumulation**: If your gift card balance is less than the total value of your purchase, you can combine it with other payment methods (like a credit card) to complete the transaction. If there‚Äôs any leftover balance, it will remain on your Amazon account for future use.

- **Easy to Redeem**: Redeeming an Amazon Gift Card is incredibly easy. Simply log in to your Amazon account, go to the "Gift Cards" section, and enter your code. The value of the card will be added to your account balance, ready to be used at checkout.

Now that you know how Amazon Gift Cards work, it‚Äôs time to explore how to make the most out of your free code.
